title: Giving Jekyll a shot
---

I'm not sure about this but since it seems to be all the hype these days I might
as well give it a try. At first I was under the impression I would miss RsT, but
then I thought what the heck, I need to get used to Markdown anyway with
everyone on github using that.

I'm trying the Jekyll @poole theme by @mdo, I think it's quite to my liking even
if I had to do some modifications to fit my username as the title of the blog
without it overflowing on the content.

I've re-edited some of my previous articles in markdown and uploaded them
here. I plan to host my future writeups and thoughts here. I'll be able to host
the associated ressources on the repo as well instead of having them scatterd
all arround the internet which is probably a good thing.
